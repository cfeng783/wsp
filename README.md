This is a tool which can automatically generate a PEPA model for a given generalized k-out-of-n: G warm standby system by following the generation rules introduced in the following paper:

Availability Modeling of Generalized k-Out-of-n:G Warm Standby Systems With PEPA, Xiaoyue Wu, Jane Hillston, Cheng Feng, IEEE Transactions on systems, man, and cybernetics: systems.

Specifically, to describe a generalized k-out-of- n:G warm standby system, one only needs to write a fairly simple file which describes the value of k, the number of repair facilities r, and the active mode failure rate λ_i, warm mode failure rate λ′_i , repair rate μ_i , number of components N_i for each group in the following text format:
k
r
λ_1, λ′_1, μ_1, N_1
...
λ_n, λ′_n, μ_n, N_n

The associated PEPA model can be generated by our tool using the following command: java -jar k-out-of-n.jar filename where filename is the directory of the description file for the generalized k-out-of-n: G warm standby system. The generated PEPA file can be directly parsed and analysed in the Eclipse environment once the PEPA analysis tool PEPA plugin (http: //www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa/documentation/) is installed. The current PEPA plugin tool can provide the steady state probability of each PEPA component. Therefore, by using the generated PEPA model, we can readily also obtain other performance measures of the system.
